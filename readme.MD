# Task Tracker (Vanilla JS)

This is a small side project where I built a lightweight task tracker using JavaScript DOM manipulation and Tailwind utility classes.

## What it does

- Add tasks from the input field.
- Mark tasks complete using a checkbox.
- Completed tasks are moved to the bottom and shown with strikethrough text.
- Unchecking a task moves it back to the top.
- Delete tasks with a trash button.

## Stack

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Files

- `index.html` - App structure, input form, and task container.
- `script.js` - Add, complete, reorder, and delete task logic.
- `LICENSE` - Project license.

## Run it

Live demo: https://oliwier-dev.github.io/task-tracker/

## Notes

- Tasks are stored only in memory for the current session (no local storage yet).
- This project focuses on core DOM/event-handling practice.


Note: This is my second project where I used Tailwind and no plain css.
